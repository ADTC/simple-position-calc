Formulae:

Target = TP Limit - Entry Price
TP Limit = Entry Price + Target
TP Limit = (Target / Reward %) + Target
Entry Price = TP Limit - Target
Reward % = Target / Entry Price
Target = Entry Price * Reward %
Entry Price = Target / Reward %
Reward Amount = Buy Amount * Reward %
Reward % = Reward Amount / Buy Amount
Sell Amount(USD) = Buy Amount (USD) + Reward Amount (USD)

Long Risk/Reward Ratio = Reward % / Risk %
Reward % = Long Risk/Reward Ratio * Risk %
Risk % = Reward % / Long Risk/Reward Ratio

Short Risk/Reward Ratio =  Risk % / Reward %
Risk % = Short Risk/Reward Ratio * Reward %
Reward % = Risk % / Short Risk/Reward Ratio

Stop = Entry Price - SL Trigger
SL Trigger = Entry Price - Stop
SL Trigger = (Stop / Risk %) - Stop
Entry Price = SL Trigger + Stop
Risk % = Stop / Entry Price
Stop = Entry Price * Risk %
Entry Price = Stop / Risk %
Risk Amount = Buy Amount * Risk %
Risk % = Risk Amount / Buy Amount
Sell Amount (USD) = Buy Amount (USD) - Risk Amount (USD)
