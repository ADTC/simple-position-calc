# Super Simple Visual Position Size Calculator

There are many position size calculators in the internet but they are complex forms that are hard to understand. I could not find any website that provides a beginner-friendly calculator which visually matches the long and short positions drawn on TradingView charts and also helps identify the values to put in the Order panel in Binance. The closest is [a Pine script](https://www.tradingview.com/script/ygBHsPqE-Position-Size-Calculator/) but there is no standalone website.

So I decided to create one. ðŸ™‚
